This software performs 3-D deconvolution of light fields using the algorithm described in [3].

This code is provided as-is: you are welcome and encouraged to
give us feedback on how the code works, but we cannot promise to
provide in-depth support at this time.  Our focus for the next several
months will be on completing our upcoming neuroscience publication so
that we can release an open source and fully supported version of this
software early next year.


For questions, please contact Michael Broxton <broxton@stanford.edu>
or Logan Grosenick <logang@stanford.edu>.


Partial list of dependencies
----------------------------
OpenCV 2.3.1 or later (with python bindings) (`apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv`)
Numpy
Scipy
scons
pyopencl, and a graphics card capable of running OpenCL programs (OpenCL v1.1 or later)

Example of use
--------------

This code can be used to construct focal stacks and deconvolved
volumes from raw light field images captured on the light field
microscope.

There is example imagery included in the 'examples/ant_leg'
subdirectory.  Consult the README contain therein for a usage
example.
